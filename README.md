# Interview Scheduler

A useful web app for allowing users to schedule their appointments, with an easy to navigate interface, all made in React. 

Users can create the interview on the day and time of their choosing, and enter their name and select the interviewer they'd like to handle this appointment. From there they can also edit or delete the interview if some of their info is off. It is all done through an easy to view, single page website.
